# DesktopPet - A Desktop Pet Application

## Features

- **Add Pets**: Select GIFs from your computer and add them as desktop pets.
- **Drag and Drop**: You can drag the pets around the screen.
- **Background Transparency**: Choose whether to display pets with a transparent background.
- **Pet Management**: View the list of available pets and remove them.
- **Pet Positioning**: Pets' positions are saved, so they will reappear in the same spot when the application is opened again.
